%%%  Welcome to the Cell Press LaTeX template,     
%%%  version 1.10. This is a minimalist template    
%%%  to help you organize your article for            
%%%  publication at Cell Press. PLEASE NOTE:

%%%  (1) If you submit your final manuscript materials 
%%%  in LaTeX format, our typesetters will prepare 
%%%  a Word file for use in production. This conversion 
%%%  process allows us to copyedit your paper, fix 
%%%  any typos, and add formatting and tagging. The 
%%%  conversion process will add approximately 3 
%%%  business days to the production timeline. 
%%%  Authors using LaTeX should keep this in mind 
%%%  when considering deadlines.

%%%  (2) Keep your LaTeX files as simple as possible. 
%%%  Avoid the use of elaborate local macros and/or 
%%%  customized external style files. If you need 
%%%  additional macros, please keep them simple and 
%%%  include them in the actual .tex document preamble. 
%%%  Source code should be set up so that all .sty 
%%%  and .bst files called by the main .tex file are 
%%%  in the same directory as the main .tex file. 

%%%  (3) Cell Press publishes more than 40 journals, 
%%%  some of which may have different or additional 
%%%  formatting requirements not specified in this 
%%%  template. When revising your paper before 
%%%  acceptance, please review the formatting 
%%%  guidelines, including the Final Files Requirements, 
%%%  for the journal you are publishing with.

%%%  Please send feedback on this template to lshipp@cell.com.

The summary (abstract) should consist of a single paragraph of 150 words or fewer.

\section*{KEYWORDS}

%%%  Include up to 10 keywords, separated by commas. 
%%%  Keywords entered in EM are not carried over; only 
%%%  keywords included in the main text will be used 
%%%  in the final article metadata. Please note that 
%%%  for some journals, keywords are chosen by the editors.

cell, press, LaTeX, template 

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

No subheadings, please. Use of abbreviations should be kept to a minimum, and nonstandard abbreviations should be defined when first used in the text.

\section*{RESULTS}

The results may be divided with subheadings. In our view, good subheadings convey information about the findings, so we encourage you to be specific. For example, "Factor X requires factor Y to function in process Z" is better than "Analysis of factors X and Y by approach Q." We recommend that you use similar language in your figure titles for clarity and structural harmony. Please do not use numbered subheadings. For some formats, ``results and discussion" may be combined under a single heading. 

\subsection*{Figures}

For initial submissions, figures and their titles and legends can be run-in with the text. For final submissions, the image files must be uploaded as separate files, one complete file per figure. The figure titles and legends should be placed toward the end of the main text, after the declaration of interests. Our typesetters will place the figures and their titles and legends appropriately based on your in-text citations.

\subsection*{Citations}

To cite/link to display items (figures and tables) and/or sections of the manuscript, simply write, for example, ``(Figure 1)" or ``see discussion." Our team will do the rest. Please note that we do not number sections or subsections.

To cite references, you may use the cite command, e.g., ``Recent articles in \textit{Matter} and \textit{Cell} \cite{wang2020conformational,king2002,cates1984statics}  have shown ..." or  ``Many interesting discoveries have been reported, \cite{radzihovsky1995new,kapoor2022leakage,hantke2018my,alcock2006} which ..." 

\subsection*{Equations}

Simple formulae should appear in line with the text whenever possible. You can write inline math by enclosing it between \verb|\(| and \verb|\)|, as in this example: \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\). You can also enclose it between dollar signs (\texttt{\$}), as in this example: $E=mc^2$.

Larger, more complex formulae may appear on a new line, either by enclosing them between \verb|\[| and \verb|\]| or by using the \verb|displaymath| environment:

\[ x^n + y^n = z^n \]

\begin{displaymath}
\sqrt{x^2+1}
\end{displaymath}

If any equations or formulae need to be referred to or cited again later in the text, use the \verb|equation| environment to number them. Later, you can cite these as "Equation 1," "Equation 2," etc.

\begin{equation}
f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{a_i}{1+x}
\end{equation}

\section*{DISCUSSION}

The discussion should explain the significance of the results and place them into a broader context. Subheadings are permitted.

\subsection*{Limitations of the study}

A "limitations" or "limitations of the study" subsection in the discussion is encouraged and may be required for some journals and some article formats.

\newpage





\noindent{The following Cell Press journals require most research articles to include their methods in a \textbf{METHODS} section, which should appear after the discussion: \textit{Cell Biomaterials}, \textit{Chem}, \textit{Chem Catalysis}, \textit{Cell Reports Physical Science}, \textit{Cell Reports Sustainability}, \textit{Device}, \textit{Joule}, \textit{Matter}, \textit{Newton}, \textit{One Earth}, and \textit{Patterns}. For all other Cell Press journals, please \textbf{delete} the contents of this page from the template and refer instead to \textbf{STAR Methods} on page 9.}

\section*{METHODS}

%%%  The methods (also/formerly called "experimental 
%%%  procedures") should appear 
%%%  immediately after the discussion. Subheadings 
%%%  may be customized. Please consult your handling 
%%%  editor if you have questions about what content 
%%%  should appear here. 


\subsection*{Custom methods subheading 1}
\subsection*{Custom methods subheading 2}
\subsection*{Custom methods subheading 3}
\subsection*{Custom methods subheading 4}

\newpage






%%%  The following components should appear after the 
%%%  methods. 
%%%  For journals using STAR Methods, these components 
%%%  should appear immediately after the discussion 
%%%  (after any "limitations" or "conclusions" subsection 
%%%  within the discussion).

\section*{RESOURCE AVAILABILITY}

%%%  The resource availability section is required 
%%%  for all research articles. This component 
%%%  has 3 subsections: "lead contact," "materials 
%%%  availability," and "data and code availability." 
%%%  All 3 subsections must be included, even if no 
%%%  unique materials were generated in the study. 
%%%  Do not edit or change the names of the subheadings. 
%%%  No other subheadings or text are allowed in the 
%%%  resource availability section.

\subsection*{Lead contact}

%%%  Authors are required to designate a lead contact, 
%%%  who will be responsible for communication with 
%%%  the journal before and after publication and is 
%%%  the arbiter of disputes, including concerns 
%%%  related to reagents or resource sharing. Only 
%%%  one author can be named the lead contact, and 
%%%  only the lead contact’s information may be 
%%%  provided in this section.

Requests for further information and resources should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Sally White (s.white@university.edu).

\subsection*{Materials availability}

%%%  This subsection must include a statement describing 
%%%  the availability of newly generated materials 
%%%  associated with the paper, including any conditions 
%%%  for access. If there are no newly generated materials 
%%%  associated with the paper, the statement should 
%%%  state this, e.g.: This study did not generate new 
%%%  materials.

Plasmids generated in this study have been deposited to [Addgene, name and catalog number or unique identifier].

\subsection*{Data and code availability}

%%%  All original research papers must include a 
%%%  comprehensive and accurate “data and code 
%%%  availability” statement within the “resource 
%%%  availability” component of the paper before it 
%%%  is accepted for publication. These statements 
%%%  are structured and consist of three bulleted 
%%%  components. Each component must be present.

\section*{MAIN TABLES, INCLUDING TITLES AND LEGENDS}

%%%  Whenever possible, we encourage you to submit 
%%%  your main-text tables as Microsoft Word documents, 
%%%  using Word's table function. This will ensure 
%%%  the best results during conversion. Tables 
%%%  should be numbered Table 1, Table 2, etc. and 
%%%  should not include subpanels (do not use Table 1A, 
%%%  1B, etc.). Give each table a brief descriptive 
%%%  title. Table legends are optional but encouraged. 
%%%  Footnotes (superscript lowercase letters) should 
%%%  be used where necessary to indicate some feature 
%%%  of the data; please do not use bold, italic, 
%%%  colored text, or shading for this purpose. Use 
%%%  separate cells, not line breaks or spaces, for 
%%%  all discrete data elements. Small embedded 
%%%  graphics with color are OK.

%%%  Like figures, all tables must be cited within 
%%%  the main text, and our typesetting team will 
%%%  place the tables within the typeset paper at 
%%%  the appropriate locations.

%%%  including the statistical tests used, exact 
%%%  value of n, what n represents (e.g., number 
%%%  of animals, number of cells, etc.), definition 
%%%  of center, and dispersion and precision 
%%%  measures (e.g., mean, median, SD, SEM, confidence 
%%%  intervals). Also, please summarize in this 
%%%  component how significance was defined, the 
%%%  statistical methods used to determine strategies 
%%%  for randomization and/or stratification, sample 
%%%  size estimation, and inclusion and exclusion 
%%%  of any data or subjects, as well as any methods 
%%%  used to determine whether the data met 
%%%  assumptions of the statistical approach.
